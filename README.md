Paxcess HJ2052 - DIY replacement controller

Using virtually any microcontroller with three analog pins.

Fix your Paxcess / AIPER HJ2052 pool robot if the internal logic board the bot dies.

This seems to happen when the one of the motors ( usually drive motor ) siezes up and board burns out.

DFROBOT Beetle and Pi PICO tested

- Recommend the Beetle as it is bare minimum for this and easier to mount.

Forward and Reverse Relay Module for Motor/Linear Actuator, Reversing Relay Module (DC 24V)
- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0879JDWP4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1
- Recommend this as it makes it easy to power and change directions of the drive motor.
- Recommend clipping off the mounting points on each side to make extra room inside.
- DC 24v is needed for the Paxcess / AIPER HJ2052 model. If you use this for anything else, make sure right voltage!

1 Channel Relay Module

- Pretty much any kind similar to this will work. 
- If can find smaller verions the better to help with the tight working space.

Replacement bearing
- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09J8BN3PF?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1
- Not necessary but this is an upgrade to the steel bearing in your robot for supporting the drive motor shaft. Coated, nylon, and ceramic made, A huge step up from the factory bearing that rusts out.

Crummy video showing my ugly build, rebuilt drive motor gear reduction box and the robot working in the pool!
